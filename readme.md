# Lightbox Example

- Common ways to close the lightbox (close button and ESC key).
- Fetching remote content.
- Rendering the content in the page.
- When the lightbox is open, the page behind it should not scroll.

#### Optional
- Build the component w/ React
- CSS animations/transitions for opening effects.
- Write in ES6 and transpile to ES5.
- Turn your lightbox into a jQuery plugin.
- Use jshint/jslint to analyze your code.
- Automate your workflow using tools like Webpack, Grunt or Gulp.
- Use Sass and a CSS autoprefixer.
- Add unit tests.
