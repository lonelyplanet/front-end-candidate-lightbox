# Lonely Planet Front End Code Test

Welcome to the Lonely Planet coding test for front end developers wishing to join our team.
All you need to do is fork this repository, make your changes, and then submit a pull request which we will then review.

## Build a lightbox

We want to see your front-end skills and how you approach a problem with a specific set of requirements.
It has been started for you, but implementation details are up to you.

### Technical Requirements

The Lightbox should support the following:

- Be able to create a lightbox instance
- Common ways to close the lightbox (close button and ESC key).
- Fetching remote content.
- Rendering the content in the page.
- When the lightbox is open, the page behind it should not scroll.

#### Optional
- Build the component w/ React
- CSS animations/transitions for opening effects.
- Write in ES6 and transpile to ES5.
- Turn your lightbox into a jQuery plugin.
- Use jshint/jslint to analyze your code.
- Automate your workflow using tools like Webpack, Grunt or Gulp.
- Use Sass and a CSS autoprefixer.
- Add unit tests.
